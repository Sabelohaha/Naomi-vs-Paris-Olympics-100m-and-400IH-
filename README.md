This was a fun hackathon project where I analyzed data from the Tokyo Olympics in order to predict who would win the upcoming Paris Olympics.
I worked on this project solo and it was fun seeing what my limits were while I was working on this. They were a lot further than I expected them to be! 
This was also the first time I pulled an all-nighter, and I didn't even feel it due to how focused I was on the project at hand! I would totally do this again if given the chance.
